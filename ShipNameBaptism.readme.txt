Title: Baptismal Font of Eternal New Ship Names and Warrior Virtues of Victory

Description: ShipBaptism provides a mechanism to easily rename all of your ships.
   If you like HOST's default use of hull names, this plugin is not for you. Read
   no more. But if you would like to have the power to quickly change your ship names
   to either match your mood at a tactical moment or sow confusion amongst your
   enemies, here's what ShipBaptism does:
   (1) Allows for ships on the starmap while you are working on your turn to display
        tactical and informative labels for you. Then when your turn is complete,
        you can swap ship name lists (saving your tactical list and loading one
        of the the other warrior lists of glory and righteous vengenace).
   (2) Maintains 7 internal shipname lists that you create and can modify.
   (3) Stores 3 long lists (fully editable) to be used as name sources for ships
        - current defualt lists included by way of example:
             Russian Field Marshalls, 1700-1915
             Metallica Song titles
             Java Error Codes
        - input your own as comma separated lists
   (4) Stores 3 short lists of words that can be randomly combined into names
        - recombinatorial diversity, 3 lists of 10 words = 1,000 unique names (10^3)
        - current default lists included by way of example:
             internal organ colors
             forces of nature
             calamitous events & supernatural powers
        -input your own as comma separated lists
   (5) You can spoof your ships with other hull names and control the race (or combo
        of races) and tech levels of hulls that you want your ships to have as names.
   (6) All manual edits to ship names via the ship management window are saved
        to the current list that is being viewed on the star map. So no info is lost
        when switching between lists.
   (7) Add a fleet prefix to your ship names (DFF = Disunited Federation of Fascists)
   (8) Combine and mix different source lists into your saved ship name lists.
        Each turn, new ships in your fleet are given a defualt name "Death Has No Name"
        in all of the saved ship name lists (except the hull name list [HOST default]
        and the tactical name list [which is an abbreviated combo of hull name and
        engine, beam and torp tech levels]). Use the "Only Replace Defaults" option
        when naming to only change those default entries, using a new/different source list.

IMPORTANT:
1. The "hull" list in ShipBaptism is the HOST default list of uppercase full hull
names. If you do not use this plugin at all, even though it is loaded, the default name behavior
of your ships will never change. The plugin will only make changes when you actively make them.

2. The ship names that will be packaged up in your turn file and will be visible to other
commanders are the ship names visible on the starmap and ship management screen when you
press "END TURN". IF YOU USE THIS PLUGIN, CHECK THAT YOUR SHIPS HAVE THE NAMES YOU INTEND
FOR THEM TO HAVE PRIOR TO CLICKING "END TURN".
