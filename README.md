AddOn plugins for Planets NU client interface

To learn how the Nu plugins work, I have used a few simple projects to explore graphic elements and ship + planet controls and variables. The code is highly derivative of other Nu plugin coders and I am thankful for the numerous examples of code available in other plugins.

1. Draw Home World Warp Circles - utilizes the Nu Draw Map addon style of Note overlays to add 81, 162 and 243 ly radii circles around your homeworld at the start of a game.

2. Load Freighters  - early in game I use a repetitive load out for MDSF/LDSF and got tired of having to click for  colonists, fuel, supplies, MCs, warp speed, and ready status. This just automates the unload/load process at your HW starbase during the first 30 turns of a game.

3. Load Lady Royale - (in progress). This was a suggested topic at McNimble's PlanetCon 2017 talk and most of a code draft was written by Whisperer. Working on finishing this up as anotehr good exercise.

4. Ship Baptism - (planned). Want to have multiple ship name lists that can be swaped out as an option during any turn. The idea is to keep one internal ship name list that is used client-side, but before submitting the turn, the ship names could be changed with other lists and these would be the names that the other players would see and the names that would be used in explosion reports.
